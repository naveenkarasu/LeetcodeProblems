  "problem": "Given an array of integers and a target sum, I need to find two elements in the array that add up to the target. The function should return their indices.",
  "idea": "My code uses a brute-force approach with nested loops to compare each pair of elements in the array. For each element at index i, it checks if there is another element at index j (where j > i) such that their sum equals the target. If a match is found, it stores the indices and returns them. This process continues until all pairs have been checked.",
