  "problem": "Given an integer, determine whether it is a palindrome number. A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward.",
  "idea": "To solve this problem, we first check if the input number is negative or zero, in which case it cannot be a palindrome. Then, we convert the absolute value of the number to a string by repeatedly taking the last digit and appending it to the front of the result. Finally, we compare the original number with its reverse; if they are equal, then the number is a palindrome.",

  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "121",
      "output": "true",
      "explanation": "The number 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left."
    },
    {
      "input": "-121",
      "output": "false",
      "explanation": "From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-, therefore it is not a palindrome."
    },
    {
      "input": "10",

      "explanation": "Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome."
