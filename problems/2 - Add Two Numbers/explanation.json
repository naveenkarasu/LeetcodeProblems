  "problem": "I need to add two numbers represented as linked lists, where each node's value is a digit. The result should also be a linked list representing the sum of the input numbers. I must handle carry values when adding digits.",
  "idea": "To solve this problem, I'll traverse both linked lists simultaneously, keeping track of any carry value that arises from adding digits. For each pair of nodes, I'll calculate their sum and create a new node with the least significant digit (i.e., the remainder when divided by 10). If there's a carry, I'll add it to the next iteration. Finally, if there's still a carry after traversing both lists, I'll create one more node for it.",
